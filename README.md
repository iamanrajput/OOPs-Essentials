# OOPs-Essentials
## Classes and Objects

Before a BMW car was made, a blueprint was designed and given to factories. All vehicles were produced based on that blueprint. In this analogy, the **object** is each vehicle produced in the factory, and the **blueprint** is the **class**.

Similarly, in programming, an object represents an entity, and the class is the instruction to design that object. Functions defined within a class are called **methods**.

- Class names start with an uppercase letter.
- Object names start with a lowercase letter.
